# What is NFT (non-fungible tokens)?

A non-fungible token is a unique digital identifier that is recorded on a blockchain, and is used to certify ownership and authenticity.NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and turned into an AI). It cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided. The ownership of an NFT is recorded in the blockchain and can be transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded.Cryptocurrencies are tokens as well; however, the key difference is that two cryptocurrencies from the same blockchain are interchangeableâ€”they are fungible. Two NFTs from the same blockchain can look identical, but they are not interchangeable.
